Q1: What was the bug?
- The bug is that the input of num1 and num2 are type of strings so num1+num2 for string is concatenation. 

Q2: How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
- I fixed the bug by "parseInt" changing the string to number so that num1+num2 do the arithmetic addition.
